# Our House Server Bot

This is an ongoing project. Mostly adding features as the need arises, but it's also good practice for stuff like working with a database, files, etc. OurHouseBot uses MongoDB and Mongoose for data storage.

It started out as a way to learn Discord.js and just to become comfortable with JS in general, applying stuff I learned in my "Programming Methodology" course.
